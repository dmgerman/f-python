* Using Functional programming

- The principles of *FP* are *simple*:
  - *lazy computation*
    - stream based operations
    - filter, map, etc
  - *no mutation*
    - more on this in a later video      

- The challenge of FP is *learning to use* it!

* Solving kattis problems

- Kattis is a great repository of problems

- [[https://open.kattis.com][open.kattis.com]]

- Great practice to improve your programming skills  


* A simple problem: millifaersla

https://open.kattis.com/problems/millifaersla/

- Read 3 numbers, each associated with a string
 - "Monnei", "Fjee", and "Dolladollabilljoll"
- Find the smallest number and print its
  corresponding string.

- Example:
  - Given 3, 9 and 7, print "Monnei"
  - given 323, 19, 999, print "Fjee"

** Extra requirement

- can you do it without any comparison?

* Finally...

- *Learning* Functional Programming
  takes practice
- Start by *solving simple problems*
  using *FP principles*
- Kattis is a great resource
