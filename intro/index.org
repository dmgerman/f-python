* Functional python: introduction

The goals of these videos are:

- to map functional programming concepts to python constructs
- to introduce functional programming features to
  a python programmer

What these videos are not:
- An introduction to python
- An introduction to functional programming

* The plan

1. The basics: functional programming (FP) features in python
   - e.g. anonymous functions,
          map/filter/fold,
          streams,
          memoization, etc.
2. How to use them:
  - solving some problems using FP python
3. The future:
   - advanced features
   - other?

* The how
- Short videos, each focusing on one topic
  - organized into playlist
- Notes in github:
  [[http://github.com/dmgerman/f-python/]]
  - organized links to all videos
- Videos will be uploaded over time
